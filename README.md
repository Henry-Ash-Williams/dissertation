# Dissertation 

~~This repository contains the files for my dissertation. The project is a web browser extension designed for Firefox and Chrome that aims to enhance the reading experience for users. It utilizes computer vision techniques, such as gaze mapping and eye tracking, to highlight the paragraph currently being read by the user. By using the webcam, the extension can detect where the user's eyes are looking on the page. This feature can be particularly helpful for users who switch tabs or get distracted from the text, as it assists them in determining their current reading position. ~~

My project seeks to build a machine learning model which takes an image from a users camera, such as their front facing camera on their phone, or the webcam on their laptop, and predicts where they are looking on the screen. Using this information, a web browser extension will bookmark the last paragraph the user was looking at before switching tabs, or otherwise causing the piece of text to go out of focus. Once they bring the text back into focus, they should be able to immediately view where they were up to in the text.
